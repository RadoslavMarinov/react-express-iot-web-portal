I have a tics since I was like 7 years old. Now I am 30. My tics underwent changes trough the years. They were more intense and decreased. Recently I had so intense tics that made me research more about them. So I searched in the internet  and I came across this https://www.tourettes-action.org.uk/ . The more I read this the more depressed I became. It was like a death sentence to me. It sais: "Tourette Syndrome is an inherited, neurological condition, the key features of which are tics, involuntary and uncontrollable sounds and movements. TS is a complex condition and a large amount of people with the condition will also experience co-occurring features and conditions." 
-Whaat? It is inherited genetic disease. Not escape then, I was thinking. Then I started to observe my behavior in relationship with the environment around me. The more stressed I was the more tics I was doing. Moreover I dont have my tics since I was born. They appeared in my childhood. And my childhood was full of stressful events. Sick parents,family fights etc.
Now I thing my tics are not a genetic disease, but coping mechanism to stress, boredom, anxiety and other discomfort in my body. There are other researches pointing  out, that tics are just behavior disorder like ADHD, Addiction, Depression, Opositionality, Conduct and other disorders have the same origin - childhood trauma. And the trauma manifests itself in these disorders. 
I would recommend people with tics or tourettes to search more alternative methods. I very much appreciate the Gabor Mate an Peter Levine work. They have a understanding of the problem that fits my gut feeling about it. Here some videos I recommend:
